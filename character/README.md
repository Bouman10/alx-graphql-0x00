# ALX GraphQL Project - Character Queries

This project contains GraphQL queries and their outputs for retrieving character information from the [Rick and Morty GraphQL API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql).

---

## **Task 0: Query a Single Character by ID**

For each character ID (1â€“4), the query retrieves:

- `id`
- `name`
- `status`
- `image`

### Files:
- `character-id-1.graphql`
- `character-id-1-output.json`
- `character-id-2.graphql`
- `character-id-2-output.json`
- `character-id-3.graphql`
- `character-id-3-output.json`
- `character-id-4.graphql`
- `character-id-4-output.json`

**Example Query (`character-id-1.graphql`):**
```graphql
query {
  character(id: 1) {
    id
    name
    status
    image
  }
}
Task 1: Get a List of All Characters (Paginated)
Using the characters(page: Int) field, queries retrieve characters from pages 1 to 4.
Selected subfields:
id
name
status
image
Files:
characters-page-1.graphql
characters-page-1-output.json
characters-page-2.graphql
characters-page-2-output.json
characters-page-3.graphql
characters-page-3-output.json
characters-page-4.graphql
characters-page-4-output.json
Example Query (characters-page-1.graphql):
query {
  characters(page: 1) {
    results {
      id
      name
      status
      image
    }
  }
}
